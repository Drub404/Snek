# Snek Beginner Projects

  This repository contains my first steps in Python.  
I use these projects to learn the basics of programming and to better understand how to build logic step by step.

Everything here is learning work: experiments, exercises, and small scripts that gradually improve over time.

## Purpose of this repository
- Learn the fundamentals of Python
- Learn to think in logic, not just syntax
- Practice:
  - variables
  - if / elif / else statements
  - booleans
  - lists & dictionaries
  - user input & validation
  - basic error handling
- Track my progress as I learn

---

## Contents (examples)
This repository may include:
- simple scripts (calculators, small games, simulations)
- Codecademy exercises
- small projects such as:
  - Magic 8-Ball
  - planet gravity calculator
  - input validation exercises
- refactored versions of older code to make it cleaner and more robust

Not every file is “perfect” and that’s intentional.
